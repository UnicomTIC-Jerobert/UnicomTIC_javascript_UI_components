    <h2>Introduction to Java Data Types</h2>
    <p>In Java, data types specify the size and type of values that can be stored in a variable. There are two types of data types in Java: Primitive data types and Non-primitive data types.</p>
    <p>Primitive data types include byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean. Non-primitive data types include classes, interfaces, and arrays.</p>
    <p>Primitive data types are predefined by the language and named by a keyword, while non-primitive data types are created by the programmer and are not predefined by the language.</p>
