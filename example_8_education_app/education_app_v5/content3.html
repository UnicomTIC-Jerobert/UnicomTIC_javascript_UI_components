    <h2>Java Control Flow Statements</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow statements in Java allow you to control the execution flow of
      your program based on certain conditions. The most commonly used control
      flow statements include if-else, switch, for loop, while loop, and
      do-while loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The if-else statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified
      condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      The switch statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to be
      executed, based on the value of an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The for loop is used to iterate over a range of values, while the while
      loop and do-while loop are used to repeat a block of code as long as a
      specified condition is true.
