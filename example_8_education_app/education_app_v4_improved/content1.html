  <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>

  <div>
    <p>Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language renowned for its portability, security features, and robustness. Developed initially by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation, Java was designed with the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on any device that supports Java without needing to be recompiled. This capability is made possible through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets Java bytecode into machine-specific instructions at runtime.</p>

    <h2>History and Evolution</h2>
    <p>Java's inception was driven by the need for a platform-independent language capable of running on various consumer electronics, from set-top boxes to web browsers. Its creators aimed to address the complexities and vulnerabilities associated with earlier languages like C++. By eliminating manual memory management through automatic garbage collection and incorporating strong typing, Java offered developers a safer and more efficient environment for large-scale application development.</p>

    <h2>Hello, World! Program</h2>
    <p>A simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Main Method in Java</h2>
    <p>In Java, every program must have a <code>main</code> method, which serves as the entry point for the JVM to start execution of the program. Here's the typical signature of a <code>main</code> method:</p>
    <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Program logic goes here
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Comments in Java</h2>
    <p>Comments in Java are used to explain code and make it more readable. There are two types of comments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single-line comments:</strong> Used to comment a single line of code. Example:</li>
      <pre><code>// This is a single-line comment</code></pre>
      <li><strong>Multi-line comments:</strong> Used to comment multiple lines or block of code. Example:</li>
      <pre><code>/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span across multiple lines
*/</code></pre>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outputting to Console</h2>
    <p>In Java, you can output text and variables to the console using <code>System.out.println()</code> method. Example:</p>
    <pre><code>System.out.println("Hello, Java!");</code></pre>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any device with a JVM. This makes Java suitable for cross-platform development, a crucial advantage in today's diverse computing environments.</li>
      <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, where everything is treated as an object. This approach promotes modular, maintainable, and reusable code.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java's security features, including bytecode verification during runtime, help prevent unauthorized access to system resources and protect against malicious code.</li>
      <li><strong>Rich API and Libraries:</strong> Java provides a comprehensive standard library (Java API) covering everything from data structures and networking to graphical user interface (GUI) development, making it easier to build complex applications quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Built-in support for multithreading enables concurrent execution of tasks, crucial for developing responsive applications that can handle multiple operations simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> While Java's performance was initially criticized compared to lower-level languages, modern JVM implementations and optimization techniques have significantly narrowed this gap, making Java suitable for high-performance applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Application Areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enterprise Applications:</strong> Java is a cornerstone of enterprise software development, powering backend systems, financial applications, and large-scale transaction processing systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Java's server-side technologies like Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate are widely used in web development, facilitating robust and scalable web applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Applications:</strong> Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system, relies heavily on Java for app development through the Android SDK.</li>
      <li><strong>Scientific and Research Computing:</strong> Java's ease of use and extensive libraries make it suitable for scientific computing, data analysis, and research applications.</li>
      <li><strong>IoT (Internet of Things):</strong> Java's lightweight runtime environment (Java ME) is used in embedded systems and IoT devices, providing connectivity and flexibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Language Syntax and Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> Java programs are organized into classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).</li>
      <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> Java supports primitive data types (int, double, boolean, etc.) and reference types (objects). Variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.</li>
      <li><strong>Control Flow:</strong> Java includes standard control flow statements such as if-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while), and exception handling (try-catch-finally).</li>
      <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Methods in Java are functions defined within a class and used to perform actions. They can have parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).</li>
      <li><strong>Inheritance and Polymorphism:</strong> Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, fostering code reuse. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or any of its subclasses.</li>
    </ul>
